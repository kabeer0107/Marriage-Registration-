What is a Marriage Certificate and Why is it Needed?
A Marriage Certificate (sometimes: marriage license) is an official statement that two people are married. In most jurisdictions, a marriage certificate is issued by a government official only after the civil registration of the marriage.
In all jurisdictions, in the India, a marriage certificate is the official record that two people have undertaken a marriage ceremony. This marriage can be registered either where husband resides or where marriage has been solemnized. 
In other countries, a marriage license serves a dual purpose of granting permission for a marriage to take place and then endorsing the same document to record the fact that the marriage has been performed.
A marriage certificate may be required for a number of reasons. It may be required as evidence of change of a party's name, on issues of legitimacy of a child, during divorce proceedings, or as part of a genealogical history, besides other purposes.,
A Marriage Certificate is the proof of registration of a marriage. The need for a Marriage Certificate arises in case you need to prove that you are legally married to someone, for purposes like obtaining a passport, changing your maiden name, etc.
